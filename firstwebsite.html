<p>That's me, trying to eat some drying fish in Norway.</p>
<p>I am a senior at Luther College. I am double majoring in math and computer science,
and I will also earn a minor in music for piano performance.</p>
<p>Although I was born and raised in Rochester, Minnesota, I have come to feel most at home when I'm at Luther in Decorah, Iowa after living <br>
and going to school here for only 3 years. It's like a magnet for quality human beings, and I'm happy to be a part of the community in this tiny little Iowa town. </p>
<p>With that being said, I don't plan on staying here forever. Ever since I went to Italy and Greece during my senior year in high school, I've <br>
been addicted to the idea of <a href="travel.html">traveling</a>. I was lucky enough to spend the Spring semester of my junior year abroad in <a href="norway.html">Norway</a>. 

<p>One of my favorite things about my experience at Luther is that it brought <a href="ultimate.html">Ultimate Frisbee</a> into my life. It's such a fun way to keep in shape, <br>
and it also got me to start <b><i>running</b></i>. In fact, I am currently looking forward to running in the <a href="http://ldl.decorahnews.com/">Loop de loop</a> race at the end of September.<br> 
It will be my second 5K race ever!!!<br>
