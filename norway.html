<h1>Semester in Tromso, Norway.</h1>

<p>My experience was too great to explain in words, so I have some pictures to do the talking.<br>
I met new friends from so many different places, which taught me a lot about both myself and how I <br>
relate to the world around me.</p>

<p>One of our favorite things to do in the mountains of Norway was:</p>
<h2>HIKING!!!!</h2>

<p>This is one of the many lakes found in-between the mountains in northern Norway. It's Spring, so the river on the right side was in full force, 
<br>but not all the snow had melted, even by June. Believe it or not, this picture was taken around 10:00pm! In the summertime, the sun never sets on Tromso. </p>

<p>This picture shows a big group of us that went hiking one snowy day in March. We have many countries 
represented here, <br>but the Germans really take the cake in this photo!</p>

<p>Over one of the last weekends that I was there, I took a week-long trip with some friends and drove to Lofoten, <br>
which is a chain of islands, mountains, and fjords of the Eastern coast of Norway.<br>
Here's one of the pictures we took overlooking one of the many small Norwegian villages we saw along the way.</br></p>
