	<p>I had never played frisbee before my junior year at Luther when I joined the women's frisbee 
	<br>team at Luther called Freya. I look forward to practice every day because I've come to <br>
	really love the sport. </p>

	<p>These are some of the few reasons why ultimate is so great:
	<ul><li>Inclusiveness. Anyone can play, everyone is accepted, and you don't have to be an exceptional athlete to <br>
	learn how to play the game.</li>
	<li>Sportsmanship. There are no referees. Players call their own fouls, and if there's a disagreement, it is <br>
	worked out between only the players directly involved. Fairness and honesty is highly encouraged.</li>
	<li>The people. I have never met a frisbee player that I don't like. Everyone is down to earth, welcoming, <br>
	and friendly.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	Some people see frisbee as just a bunch of bros throwing around a disc, but it's much more than that. <br>
	The sport has its very own culture which is welcoming and relaxed, but also competitive. It makes for an <br>
	atmosphere that no other sport could create. </p>
